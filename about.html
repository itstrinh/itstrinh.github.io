								<h3> Overview </h3>
								<p>Hello! My name is Trinh Duong. I am currently a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Business Administration and working towards a Certificate in Entrepreneurship Technology. I will be graduating in the spring of 2018. Having grown up in a low-income community in the heart of Silicon Valley, I developed a strong interest in the crossroads of business, social impact, and technology. 
								</p>

								<h3> Academics </h3>
								<p>I went to Andrew P. Hill High School and graduated in 2014. While there, I took International Baccaleureate classes and received the highest scoring IB diploma in my class after graduation. My unweighted GPA was 3.9.

								<h3> Personal </h3>
								<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, urban exploring, bargain hunting and trying new food (I will eat almost anything)! I guess you can say that I enjoy semi-adventurous activities where I am able to put myself out there without being too dangerous. 
								<br> <br> 
								Outside of what I like to do, my interests lie in social impact, technological innovation, crime/mysteries, and anything fashion/design related. I know that probably sounds like a strange combination, but I promise you I am not THAT weird.
